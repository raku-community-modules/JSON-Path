=head1 NAME

JSON::Path - Implementation of the JSONPath data structure query language

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use JSON::Path;

# Example data.
my $data = {
  kitchen => {
    drawers => [
      { knife => '🔪' },
      { glass => '🍷' },
      { knife => '🗡️' },
    ]
  }
};

# A query
my $jp = JSON::Path.new('$.kitchen.drawers[*].knife');

# The first result
dd $jp.value($data);  # "🔪"

# All results.
dd $jp.values($data); # ("🔪", "🗡️").Seq

# All paths where the results were found.
dd $jp.paths($data);  # ("\$.kitchen.drawers[0].knife",
                      #  "\$.kitchen.drawers[2].knife").Seq

# Interleaved paths and values.
dd $jp.paths-and-values($data);
# ("\$.kitchen.drawers[0].knife", "🔪",
#  "\$.kitchen.drawers[2].knife", "🗡️").Seq
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<JSONPath query language|https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>
was designed for indexing into JSON documents. It plays the same role
as XPath does for XML documents.

This module implements C<JSON::Path>. However, it is not restricted to
working on JSON input. In fact, it will happily work over any data
structure made up of arrays and hashes.

=head1 Query Syntax Summary

The following syntax is supported:

=table
query     | description
----------+------------
$         | root node
.key      | index hash key
['key']   | index hash key
[2]       | index array element
[0,1]     | index array slice
[4:5]     | index array range
[:5]      | index from the beginning
[-3:]     | index to the end
.*        | index all elements
[*]       | index all elements
[?(expr)] | filter on (Raku) expression
..key     | search all descendants for hash key

A query that is not rooted from C<$> or specified using C<..> will be
evaluated from the document root (that is, same as an explicit C<$> at
the start).
